# Pipeline Library for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK
 
 
## Description

 This pipeline library contains the steps required by the [Pipeline for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline) and should be used together with it.
 
 ## Requirements
 
 The project has the same requirements as for the project [Pipeline for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline). Please follow the instruction for the pipeline project.
 
 ## Download and Installation
 
 The pipeline library should be used together with the [Pipeline for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline).
 Thus, you have to create a project using this pipeline.
 A description how to achieve that can be found in the [Download and Installation](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline/blob/master/README.md#download-and-installation) of the pipeline project.
